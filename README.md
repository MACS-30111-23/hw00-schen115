# Siqi Chen

## Brief introduction about myself
Hi everyone! My name is **Siqi Chen** and I'm from **China**. I study both *economics and psychology* in my undergraduate program. In my spare time, I love to play video games, watch movies, explore cities, and cook with my roommate at home. 
My GitHub link is [Siqi Chen GitHub](https://github.com/MACS-30111-23/hw00-schen115). 

## Shared Pics
The pics below is my roommate and I eat Qiaolin Hotpot last week. We think is one of the best hotpot we eat in U.S.

## Summary & Reflection 
* This is my first time to use GitHub workflow which is a quite different from R and python programmming. I learned we use # to add header, which # means a first-level heading, ## means a second-level, and ### means a third-level. And if we want to emphasis with bold, we need to use syntax ** ** while if we want italics, we need to use * *. Moreover, if we want to add unordered lists on our README, we need to add * before each line. Meanwhile, if we want to add a link, we can created by wrapping link text in brackets [ ] while wrapping the URL link in parentheses ( ). Additionally, when we intend to embed pictures in README, we can use ![Alt text](URL link of image) if you have already put the image in the repository. Otherwise, you can just drag and drop the image.
* I think README is a good way to provide information about ourselves or projects because this markdown file is really convenient and efficient.
